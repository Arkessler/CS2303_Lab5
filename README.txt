As it stands the program has a functioning map, as well as functions for movement, but it still needs implementation of 
store queues. Main currently prints out the map and reads in data, printing out the destinations that it has read in.

All the map and movement code was either written or adapted by Alexi Kessler. 
When code has been adapted, it is from C code written by Professor Robert Kinicki, as detailed in the comments for the individual
source files.

Queue code and implementation written by Max Li.
