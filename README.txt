As it stands the program has a functioning map, as well as functions for movement, but it still needs implementation of 
movement with store queues. Main currently prints out the map and reads in data, printing out the destinations that it has read in.
We haven't been able to figure out why the simulation consistently starts at time 9, this would seem to be the same in the code for
program 2 that Professor Kinicki wrote, and we haven't been able to identify the reason.
The rr queue initial implementation is functional, but reached functionality too late to be able to implement the queue in the 
actual program.  The basic implementation is included in the tar as a separately tarred file.

All the map and movement code was either written or adapted by Alexi Kessler. 
When code has been adapted, it is from C code written by Professor Robert Kinicki, as detailed in the comments for the individual
source files.

Queue code and implementation written by Max Li.
Base code of functions adapted from C code written by Professor Rober Kinnicki, detailed in the source files.
